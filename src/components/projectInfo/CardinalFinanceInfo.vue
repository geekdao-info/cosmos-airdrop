            >CARDINAL Finance is a decentralized lending protocol for individuals, institutions and
            protocols to access financial services. It is a permissionless, open source and
            blockchain agnostic protocol serving users on Juno. Users who are passively holding Juno
            can deposit their assets on CARDINAL to earn yield, similar to a traditional savings
            account.</a-typography-paragraph

            >The total supply of $PRIMO tokens will be set at 50,000 tokens with no function to mint
            in the future, this means that there will forever be only 50,000 $PRIMO to ever exist.
            We believe that this limited supply backed with the amazing platforms and utilities in
            our ecosystem will drive the value of the tokens to an amazing
            height.</a-typography-paragraph
