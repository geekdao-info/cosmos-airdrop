        <a-typography-paragraph>
            NETA is money on the Juno Network. Itâ€˜s sole purpose is to function as
            <a-typography-text mark>a scarce decentralized store of value</a-typography-text> asset
            for the Juno ecosystem and inter-chain Cosmos at large.Claimable for free by thousands
            of Juno delegates at inception. Never a seed sale, private sale or public sale.
            Verifiable zero NETA is held in reserve by any third party ie. developers, teams,
            founders or companies. The Juno community owns all NETA in existence. Distributed widely
            and fairly via the criteria, listed in the distribution section.
